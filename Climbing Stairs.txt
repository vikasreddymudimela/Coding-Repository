This is dynamic programming here the goal is to find how many ways to react the top of stairs 

Here The Problem is done through a reverse approch the problems is solved backwards
 for example the ways of reaching from n-1 step to n step is one and ways of reaching n to n is one
 for n-3 step ways are n-2 and n-1 it is dynamic programming 
 because you can take only one step to n-1 and two steps to n-2 and after that the no of ways to reach n are previously computed
