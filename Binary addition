Here The challenge is to add two numbers without using plus or minus
here the xor and and operators are used to perform addition
the operations are repated till there is no carry
while(b!=0){
            int temp = (a&b)<<1;
            a=a^b;
            b = temp;
        }
        return a;

        Xor and and is performed till the carry is 0
        9 =
