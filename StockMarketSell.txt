Here the problem is to sell the stocks for maximum profit the constraint is you can only sell the stock after you buy it
So the simple strategy is to buy low and sell high for maximun profit
The solution is of a two pointer solution
you can also use one pointer approach
The one pointer by chatgpt helps the best
 
        int low = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int MaxProfit=0;
        for(int price:prices){
            if(price<low){
                low=price;
            }
            else{
                MaxProfit = Math.max(price-low,MaxProfit);
            }
        }
        return MaxProfit;
